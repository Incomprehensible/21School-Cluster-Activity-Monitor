# 21School-Cluster-Activity-Monitor
In order to visualize clusters computers accesibility for students and make finding a coding place for oneself easier, School 21's Lab Manager came out with the idea of autonomous Cluster Activity Monitor. It should be set up on each floor and light up LEDs, showing which monitors are taken and which a free to use. It's connected to local network and pulls data from dedicated server. Done by team: Ricky, Bomanyte.
